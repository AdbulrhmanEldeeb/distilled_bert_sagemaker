Cost Management:

Use spot instances for training to reduce costs
Monitor your usage and delete endpoints when not in use


Performance Optimization:

Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance
Consider using a smaller batch size if you encounter memory issues


Production Deployment:

Set up auto-scaling for your endpoint to handle varying loads
Implement proper error handling in your inference script


Model Monitoring:

Use SageMaker Model Monitor to track data drift
Set up CloudWatch alarms for endpoint metrics


Security:

Use IAM roles with the least privilege principle
Encrypt your data at rest and in transit
